# Create Your Own Faction — HOI4 Mod

This mod allows players (and only players) to freely create their own factions in both singleplayer and multiplayer, independent of ideology, focus trees, or country rules.

## Features
- A unique national spirit unlocks faction creation
- A decision lets the player create a custom-named faction
- Fully compatible with multiplayer
- AI is restricted from using the system
- Optional compatibility patches for:
  - Millennium Dawn
  - Road to 56

## Purpose
By default in HOI4, only major powers like Germany, the UK, and the USSR start with the ability to form factions. Others gain this ability only through national focuses or scripted events. This mod bypasses those limitations — giving the player full agency to form and name their own faction regardless of starting nation or ideology.

## Compatibility
- ✅ Base Game
- ⚙️ Millennium Dawn (patch in development)
- ⚙️ Road to 56 (patch in development)
- ❌ Not intended for AI usage

## Mod Structure

- [x] Custom faction creation via decision
- [x] National spirit to unlock decision
- [x] Player-only access

## Notes
- You must enable this mod before game start.
- This mod is safe to use mid-game, but faction creation is only available to countries not already in a faction.
